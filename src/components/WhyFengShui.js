                            are dirty. There are no windows and therefore no cross ventilation. No greenery, no peace. Can
                            you live in a house like that for the rest of your life? Would you want to?
                            Then why would you force your soul to live in a house like that?
                            Welcome to Ancient Feng Shui: the art of using elements of Nature to clean up your life. Welcome
                            to the first day of achieving your inner greatness. Namaste.</p>
